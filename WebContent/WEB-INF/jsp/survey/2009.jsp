		<td>Things to add to our list for next year</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>I have a 5 gallon beverage dispenser that I could bring.</li>
				<li>I didn't mind having left-over muffins.  I'd rather not run out.  5 dozen does seem to be enough though.  We also had more than enough beverages, we didn't even use the punch Carrie brought cause we made extra pink lemonade that I had brought (sorry Carrie).  Let's assign someone to bring lemon aid next year and have it for in between meals.  personally loved the beef!  We did run out of cups.  We should bring enough for in between meals as well.</li>
				<li>The Lap Blankets are covered..I have connections, Connie</li>
				<li>A wider variety of games to play in the family room.</li>
				<li>Wall chart with names of all generations of the family and who's in which ones</li>

		<td>What additions to the food list?</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>some kind of fruit or fruit salads with the main meal on Saturday.</li>
				<li>Did we assign snacks for Fri and Sat night to anyone?</li>
				<li>Hot Cocoa</li>
				<li>Maybe a case of oranges/or mixed with apples to snack on</li>

		<td>Other suggestions for events or things to do next year?</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>500 tournament</li>
				<li>How about having the Saturday all together meal around 4:30 or 5:00 pm and have a brunch earlier in the day so it is more relaxing?</li>
				<li>I think we should continue to give Cragun's some business and have the catered meal.  Cooking for 100 people is not fun!!  We're preparing for a small wedding.  Plus, no one wants to sign up to bring food.  Everyone wants to bring beverage containers, paper products, etc.  People want to come and enjoy the time, not be cooking, setting up meals, cleaning up, etc.</li>
				<li>Volley ball setup for Saturday evening would be the best. This may clash with the animal show though.</li>
				<li>For meal set up, several families can sign up as teams to do one of the meals, more families together for bigger meals</li>
				<li>Just to keep the volleyball courts reserved for Friday and Saturday like we did in 2008.</li>
				<li>Skiing was great on the trails at the nearby Legacy golf course in 2008.  If we have snow again next year consider joining us.  Marlene &amp; Dan</li>
