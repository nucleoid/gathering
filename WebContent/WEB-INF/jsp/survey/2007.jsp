need about 2/3 the amount of beef ordered	<br />

Should add raw veggies for supper.	<br />
nice change maybe every other year?	<br />
was't great	<br />
we ran out of potatoes I think	<br />
maybe add a veggie	<br />
Great! Loved the beef!	<br />

The food is better when it's homemade.	<br />
It costs just as much money to make the food than to have it catered.  The weekend should be stress free...not having to prepare food!	<br />
either,  don't want to put people out if it's not affordable for everyone to cater	<br />
too many people to bring for	<br />
We get an excellent deal on rooms at Craguns.  We should really support the resort and use their restaurant facilities.  Potluck is too much work when the family is so large.  Wasn't the agreement to switch every other year?<br />	
less work, more fair as some get stuck providing more than they should	<br />
for the price, I think the potluck works better	<br />
Catered was too expensive.	<br />

Comments:<br />
$20 might be better<br />
I'd like a $15 to $20 range.<br />
maybe $20  again not so much that people can't afford to take part<br />
they need to be light-hearted; this price is good<br />
Need to decide whether or not to have "Male" or "Female" written on gift.. just so it's across the board and not confusing.<br />
</div>
<h4>Is there anything you'd add to the activities schedule?</h4>
 an extra day, Friday<br />
 another reserve time in the gym<br />
 just right<br />
No, I really enjoy what is offered<br />
Volleyball on Saturday afternoon or evening<br />
Maybe something organized to have family pictures taken with each family's camera, a semi-organized game night on Saturday, more options for sleigh rides (talk to Cragun's about this?)<br />
saturday night vollyball <br />
<h4>Is there anything you'd remove from the activities schedule?</h4>
Santa's not required, but the volunteers have been wonderful.  Fitting it in right before lunch did leave more free time in our schedules.<br />
leave it more open <br />
<h4>Any other questions?</h4>
more rolls at breakfast and shorter breakfast time slot <br />
more help from the guys with meal prep and clean-up <br />
possibly do catered for those who want too and potluck for those who want to do that.  Keep everyone happy!!<br />
more people at worship on Sunday<br />
More time being able to spend and relax with family rather than having to stress about preparing food <br />
move the Sunday worship a little earlier<br />
<h4>What other changes would you like to see?</h4>
can we get the same discount rate on the rooms if we come a day earlier as well <br />
If we'd like to come up on the Thursday prior, (to be able to have more of a vacation) would we still be able to get the discounted rate?<br />
